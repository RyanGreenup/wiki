# Applications
While trying to do a quizz I needed to screenshot some answers, anyway it was a fucking nightmare using Office Software to store them in and eventually I settled on Zim.

Zim is really great and although I'm sold on just doubling down on a wiki platform, something a little lighter, local and snappy could be useful for information that I will need to refer to over the span of say 20 minutes but that I don't need to archive (like quizzes).

The only issue is that Zim doesn't support math really, so, that's a deal breaker, these are some possible alternatives:

* Cherry Tree?

## Wikis
* [raneto](http://docs.raneto.com/install/installing-raneto)

* [Installing Pepperminty](/University/Installing-Pepperminty.md)
* [Grav](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/admin-panel/page/editor) supports editing content as well.
