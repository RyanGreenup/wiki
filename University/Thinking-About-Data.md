Choosing a Test
===============

-   A Chi-Squared Test is used for two groups of discrete data
-   A $t$-test is used for for one continuous and one discrete
- If there's more than one group then it's *ANOVA*, [ANOVA](/University/Thinking-About-Data/Thinking-About-Data/ANOVA) this has the disadvantage of not being able to tell the direction of the difference.
-   Something is binomial if it represents the count of the number of
    successes from $n$ trials
-   Poisson is something discrete that occurs in discrete intervals of
    time, such as for example the number of phone calls in a day
-   *ANOVA* is used for comparing multiple groups.
