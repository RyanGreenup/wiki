# I love that it's just Markdown

I can put text and make notes and there just mine, it's a lot smoother than dealing with *MediaWiki*'s non-standard format.

```bash
echo Hello World!
```

```jl
print("Hello World")
```
[mynewfile](./mynewfile)

$$
\oint \frac{1}{z} \mathrm{d}x \qquad \ldots \qquad \text{(3)}
$$

I even included a screenshot
