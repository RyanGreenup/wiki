## Relative Links
In WikiJS the links didn't work as being relative, they now do see:

> [./path/to/link.md](/path/to/link.md)

 type the following:
 
     [](
     
 then  start typing the ` title `  character and it should auto completes the path.
 
  so to makea link you must know the title  of the page
