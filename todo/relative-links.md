# Link Tests



So I made a link to this page but then moved this page, then the link broke, so id need to manually fix the link


[thisbis where i moved the page](/linux/relative-links)

what this means is that ***Every Page MUST have a unique name***

I wonder if there is any advantage to just using a flat folder structure?? Maybe symlink index.md to home md
