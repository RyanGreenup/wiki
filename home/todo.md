Todo for Wiki
=============

-   ~~Get `org-publish` working properly~~
	+ Make a public server for Certain Notes inside `~/Public/Org`
-   Get `WikiJS` set up on something other than [IsDockertooSlow](/home/IsDockertooSlow)
-   Figure out a way to backup the WikJS stuff
-   I like the idea of git, obviously, using *GitHub* isn\'t ideal
    though.
- I'd need to set up `ssh` first though, which means I'd need to set up `ssh` keys (or have a really long password).
  - I could change it so I don't need to enter the password everytime I sudo, I could also make it memorable.
   - I should write my main password down somewhere actually
-   Is there a way to set it up locally with the file system
    -   \[Actually yeah the documentation suggests maybe there
        is!\](<https://docs.requarks.io/storage/git>)
-   ~~Make sure [`recoll `](/home/todo/Recoll-Search-Engine) is working on the laptop~~
-   Add it onto `noip` so I don\'t have to use the ip-address.
-   ~~Make some pages private~~
    -   ~~You\'ll [find the setting
        here](./http://121.210.19.69:81/a/groups/2)~~
        -   just use the `private` tag.
-   Make a self hosted git repo
-   Integrate the module with the self hosted git repo
-   Set up SeaFile or [NextCloud](./https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/example_ubuntu.html), this requires changing permissions
    -   It doesn\'t actually look too hard, It might be a matter of
        extracting a tarball on my
        \[Apache-Server\](/home/todo/Apache-Server)
-   ~~Import a base64 HTML~~
  - [See this page here](./University/SocialWebAnalytics/Visualising-Multi-Dim-Data)
-   Try and find local data from local sync
    -   here\'s a string `892389238923`
- Can I get better mobile support?
- Look at [some other self-hosted ideas like to-do lists](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#task-managementto-do-lists)

 another option i think was  something liketk wint but it was ancient,  although  features rich  
 
 i  need to  forest get this working with git, get recoll set up  Fix org publish, settle on a publishmd path, get WikiJS set up on its forever server, get ssh working, get a local git repo and then set up nextcloud for calendar and cloud storage
