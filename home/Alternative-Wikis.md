Alternatives
============

I tried tiddly wiki but out if the box it required a tonne ofset up for
math and markdown

-   mediawiki is really good but feels ancient nect to wikijs
    -   like no tags sucks
    -   the non-standard format makes it difficult to use
-   *WikiJS* is great because it has good search, tags, syncs markdown
    with git, has a pleasant git-diff
    -   It\'s a little rough on mobile though.
    -   KaTeX means it doesn't scale as well as say *MediaWiki*
    - Checkout [this page](http://ryansnotes.org/mediawiki/index.php/Abstract_Algebra) compared to [this one](/University/Abstract-Algebra) for example, although that might scale better in org roam?
-   [tikiwiki](http://doc.tiki.org/Keywords) sounds promising

Cloud Storage
-------------

the the options are seafile, nextcloud and owncloud. next cloud seems
like the most modern with the better app
