# Our Wiki

The more ~~students~~ people that collaborate here the more useful
this will be to everybody so please, make some input.

> As an aside I was sort of torn between this wiki and [this dokuwiki
> instance](http://ryansnotes.org:82/dokuwiki/doku.php), maybe others could provide some input on this? some of
> the advantages and disadvantages are discussed in [this page](./wikijs-vs-dokuwiki.md)
{.is-info}


The input for this wiki is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/RyanGreenup/wiki) [^1] and i'll
write in structions on how to implement your own local version of
WikiJS [here](./implement-local-instance-of-wikijs.md) (as well as [dokuwiki](./implement-local-instance-of-dokuwiki.md) and [mediawiki](./implement-local-instance-of-mediawiki.md).

## Starting points

- [Notetaking](./Notetaking/home.md)

[^1]: Although this might change to [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) in the future.
