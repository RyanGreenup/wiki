Now as I write in here
It just works
# New Version (Beta)
## Bugs
This version fixes [./relative-links](./relative-links) but you can't delete home, you can only move it, edge-case though tb.
jibbletag

I have since added the tags in, are they no longer added to the YAML????

## New Features
* Kroki
* MathJax
* Mobile Editing is now bearable
  * In saying that editing straight to the wiki is actually a lot nicer, I much prefer it because theres no fucking around with sync
  * the  comparability If wikiJS with  markdown  and GitHub means it is the clear   choice compared to  mediawiki
* links work
* Tag export for git sync still omits square brackets
  * Still though I could just use `rg` and some thinking to pass these tags to *TMSU* anyway so this might not be as big an issue as I made it out to be.

Consider joplin vs wikiJS on light of org roam server and even other options like leanote  

also whats the risk of http if im just going to use mobile data
