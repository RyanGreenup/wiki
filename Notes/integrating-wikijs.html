<h1>Integrating With Note Taking Generally</h1>
<p>The best solution here is to extract the yaml tags by hand and then pass them to TMSU</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>I should also write a script to symlink myself without TMSU, that way I wouldn't be locked in</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be a solution in the sense that I wouldn't need to use any app to browse the tags, the issue would only be searching, but, recoll works fine for searching and I can just switch the default editor to <i>VSCode</i> and I'm set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a script to extract yaml tags with `ripgrep` and `cut`</li>
  <li>Write Write a script to interface that with TMSU<ol>
      <li>This is the real trick, I just need to write a plan on how to implement this<ol>
          <li>Once Tags are represented through the file system searching through notes and tags will be really eazy with fzf (e.g. `<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">ls | fzf | xargs cd ` </span>and just using recoll</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Find a nice way to browse through the tmsu mounted tags with vscode</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is only a little bit necessary though to be honest, although a wysiwyg editor for markdown would be really nice</p>
