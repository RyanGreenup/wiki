<p>So at first I thought a significant issue with <i>wiki JS </i>was the searching, but the more I use it the more I think that it actually makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iff Notes have a sensible title, description and file name/path then thatâ€™s all that should be shown in the search results.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i do like that, for example,&nbsp;<i> &nbsp;MediaWiki</i>, and perhaps Dokuwiki/moin moin/tiki wiki/xwiki &nbsp;display the content that was matched but this is actually really sensible.&nbsp;</p>
