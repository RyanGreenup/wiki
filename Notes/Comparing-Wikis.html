<h2>Wiki JS</h2>
<p><br>So at first I thought a significant issue with <i>wiki JS </i>was the searching, but the more I use it the more I think that it actually makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iff Notes have a sensible title, description and file name/path then that’s all that should be shown in the search results.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like that, for example,&nbsp;<i> &nbsp;MediaWiki</i>, and perhaps Dokuwiki/moin moin/tiki wiki/xwiki &nbsp;display the content that was matched but this is actually really sensible.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&nbsp;Mediawiki</h2>
<p>I love it but for two deal breakers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>content is difficult to get in and out</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - and consequent difficult to backup</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;the &nbsp;Visual editor is extremely difficult to set up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>pepperminty wiki</h2>
<p>&nbsp;it’s quite nice but no PDF attachment and no syntax highlighting is a bummer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>wikitten&nbsp;</h2>
<p>nice but no full text search</p>
<h2>&nbsp;Dokuwiki</h2>
<p>&nbsp;i think I prefer this over MediaWiki in that it’s similar &nbsp;but way easier to set up.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>non standard syntax is a shame though</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>moin moin</h2>
<p>&nbsp; the Mobile seemed ugly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
