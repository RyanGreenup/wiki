<h2>Wiki JS</h2>
<p><br>So at first I thought a significant issue with <i>wiki JS </i>was the searching, but the more I use it the more I think that it actually makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iff Notes have a sensible title, description and file name/path then thatâ€™s all that should be shown in the search results.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like that, for example,&nbsp;<i> &nbsp;MediaWiki</i>, and perhaps Dokuwiki/moin moin/tiki wiki/xwiki &nbsp;display the content that was matched but this is actually really sensible.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&nbsp;Mediawiki</h2>
<p>I love it but for two deal breakers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>content is difficult to get in and out</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - and consequent difficult to backup</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;the &nbsp;Visual editor is extremely difficult to set up.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
