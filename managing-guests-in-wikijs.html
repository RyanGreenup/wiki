<h1>Behaviour</h1>
<p>Any user that visits without loging in is clased as the `guest ` user, this user belongs to the ` guests ` group, in order to allow access, you must add a rule specifically allowing this group to read pages, Ive used tags to help manage it, see for example:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/1dc5ef87-7e24-471f-8369-73ee52975f43.jpeg"></figure>
<p><br>How hard is it for users to make an account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>New Users</h2>
<p>If you set up Auth0, exactly as described <a href="https://docs.requarks.io/en/auth/auth0">here</a>, new accounts can be made, local does not work.</p>
<p>I put both http and https because as <i><strong>Allowed Callback URLs</strong></i><strong> &nbsp;</strong>because I haven't had time to enable <i>Lets Encrypt</i> through docker.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; http://ryansnotes.org:81/login/auth0/callback,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; https://ryansnotes.org:81/login/auth0/callback<br>&nbsp;</p>
