<h1>Behaviour</h1><p>Any user that visits without loging in is clased as the `guest ` user, this user belongs to the ` guests ` group, in order to allow access, you must add a rule specifically allowing this group to read pages, Ive used tags to help manage it, see for example:</p><figure class="image"><img src="/1dc5ef87-7e24-471f-8369-73ee52975f43.jpeg"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p>
